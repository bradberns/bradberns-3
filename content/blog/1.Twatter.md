### Elon is the twat in Twatter

On Friday evening, two days before Christmas, I found out my
promomotional account, of over 7 years was suspended from Twitter.
To say I was shocked, baffled, and irritated; is an understatement.
After checking my email, Twitter found that two (2) of my
tweets were in violation of their policy.

Here is the rub. The tweets that violated their TOS are from 6 (six)
years ago, an account that no longer exists, and multiple other accounts
did exactly the same thing I did. And I have the receipts.

Whether I get my account back or not, don't expect me to go away
anytime soon.

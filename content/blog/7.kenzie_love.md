### Welcome back

Today I am highlighting<span class="text-blue-800 font-semibold"> Kenzie Love.
</span> Kenzie has been in the adult industry, from the age of 18. I find Kenzie's
story interesting, since she lives out of her van, creates her own content and
works for a bunch of the bigger porn compamies. Hopefully you will find her
ineresting as well.

### Getting into the Industry

How did you get into the sex work industry?

<p class="quote">I started out as a dancer for a few years, I was barely 18. I didn't
enjoy the late nights. And my beloved Uber driver, who always picked me up from
the club, told me about webcamming. I quickly fell in love working on my own time
and behind a screen.
</p>

Which platform did you used to cam on?

<p class="quote">I was on myfreecams. But I ultimately left that behind.
Traveling & living in a van, and live streaming everyday, wasn't possible.
I ran out of data very quickly.

How did you find your way into some of the larger porn companies.

<p class="quote">I started creating content, as additional options on my webcam page.
And then the collaborations started. After creaating content independently. I
decided to join in on larger prductions. I haven't looked back since. I love being
in front of the camera. And having someone edit my scene is a blessing. LOL

### Vanilla Life

Everyone in the porn biz has outside interests. How we make money, doesn't define
who we are. Tell everyone about your "vanilla" life.

<p class="quote">I am a licensed asthetician. I worked in the spa industry, while
simultaneously camming. I loved having an outlet to talk to other women, in such
a zen space. While making people feel more comfortable in their own skin. I have
been a nomad for most of my adult life. Packing up and moving across the country,
was normal for me. So when I found out I could convert a van and travel with all
my things, I jumped right into that lifestyle. I love parking deep in the forest
and being able to hear nothing, but the birds and trees, while I dive into a good
book and relax with my dog.
